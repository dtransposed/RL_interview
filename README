How to run:
    1. Install dependencies.
    2. Run main script.

I have decided to tackle the FrozenLake8x8 challenge, mostly due to the constrained computing resources.
The algorithm and the model are really minimal, but they reliably solve the environment for both:
 1. is_slippery = True
 2. is_slippery = False

No tests are provided, I do not think that such a simple training script requires tests.
I spent a significant amount of time setting up the dockerfile, but since lately gym is being very weakly supported,
it took me a lot of time to try to find a good image / setup my own working one. Given just a handful of requirements,
I do not think it is necessary.
