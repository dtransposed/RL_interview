How to run:
    1. Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
    2. Run main.py script.

I have decided to tackle the FrozenLake8x8 challenge, mostly due to the constrained computing resources.
The algorithm and the model are really minimal, but they reliably solve the environment for both:
 1. is_slippery = True
 2. is_slippery = False

No tests are provided, I do not think that such a simple training script requires tests.
Given just a handful of requirements, I do not think that creating a dockerfile is necessary.
